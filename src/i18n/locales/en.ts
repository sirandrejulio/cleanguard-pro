  // FAQ
  faq: {
    title: "Frequently Asked Questions",
    items: [
      {
        q: "How does the video evidence protection work?",
        a: "Your team records short walkthrough videos before and after each job using our mobile app. Each video is automatically tagged with GPS coordinates, timestamps, and a unique cryptographic hash that proves it hasn't been altered. If a customer disputes the quality of work, you have irrefutable, timestamped proof.",
      },
      {
        q: "Will this actually save me money?",
        a: "Our customers save an average of $3,500/month on the Professional plan. Just one prevented chargeback ($500+) or three filled cancellations ($450+) more than covers the monthly cost. Most businesses see ROI within the first week.",
      },
      {
        q: "How does the AI route optimization work?",
        a: "Our AI analyzes your daily jobs, team locations, traffic patterns, and job durations to create the most efficient routes. It considers real-time traffic, job priorities, and team capacity. Most businesses see a 25-35% reduction in drive time.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can my team use this on their phones?",
        a: "Yes! CleanGuard Pro includes a mobile app for iOS and Android. Your cleaning teams can record videos, check in/out with GPS verification, and view their daily routes — all from their phones, even offline.",
      },
      {
        q: "What happens when a customer cancels last-minute?",
        a: "Our FILL module automatically matches the open slot with customers on your waitlist. It sends instant SMS offers with optional discounts and tracks responses in real-time. On average, 78% of cancellations are filled within 2 hours.",
      },
      {
        q: "Is my data secure?",
        a: "Absolutely. All data is encrypted at rest and in transit. Video evidence is stored with immutable hashes that prevent tampering. We use enterprise-grade infrastructure with SOC 2 compliance, and your data is never shared with third parties.",
      },
